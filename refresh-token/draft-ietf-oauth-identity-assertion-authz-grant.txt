               Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
         draft-ietf-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant-latest

Abstract

   This specification provides a mechanism for an application to use an
   identity assertion to obtain an access token for a third-party API by
   coordinating through a common enterprise identity provider using
   Token Exchange [RFC8693] and JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Grants [RFC7523].

1.  Introduction

   In typical enterprise scenarios, applications are configured for
   single sign-on to the enterprise identity provider (IdP) using OpenID
   Connect or SAML.  This enables users to access all the necessary
   enterprise applications using a single account at the IdP, and
   enables the enterprise to manage which users can access which
   applications.

   When one application wants to access a user's data at another
   application, it will start an interactive OAuth flow [RFC6749] to
   obtain an access token for the application on behalf of the user.
   This OAuth flow enables a direct app-to-app connection between the
   two apps, and is not visible to the IdP used to log in to each app.

   This specification enables this kind of "Cross App Access" to be
   managed by the enterprise IdP, similar to how the IdP manages single
   sign-on to individual applications.

   The draft specification Identity Chaining Across Trust Domains
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining] defines how to request a JWT
   authorization grant from an Authorization Server and exchange it for
   an Access Token at another Authorization Server in a different trust
   domain.  The specification combines OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
   [RFC8693] and JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client
   Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523].  The draft
   supports multiple different use cases by leaving many details of the
   token exchange request and JWT authorization grant unspecified.

   This specification defines the additional details necessary to
   support interoperable implementations in enterprise scenarios when
   two applications are configured for single sign-on to the same
   enterprise identity provider.  In particular, this specification uses
   an Identity Assertion as the input to the token exchange request.
   This way, the same enterprise Identity Provider that is trusted by
   applications for single sign-on can be extended to broker access to
   APIs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Roles

   Client  The application that wants to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access
      token on behalf of a signed-in user to an external/3rd party
      application's API (Resource Server below).  In
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Client in trust
      domain A.  The application has a direct relationship with the IdP
      Authorization Server for single sign-on as a Relying Party and
      another independent OAuth 2.0 client relationship with the
      Resource Authorization Server in trust domain B.

   IdP Authorization Server (IdP)  A SAML 2.0 Identity Provider or
      OpenID Connect Provider (OP) [OpenID.Core] that issues Identity
      Assertions for single sign-on and cross-domain authorization
      grants Section 3 for a set of trusted applications in an
      organization's application ecosystem.  In
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Authorization
      Server in trust domain A, which is also trusted by the Resource
      Authorization Server in trust domain B.

   Resource Authorization Server (AS)  Issues OAuth 2.0 access tokens
      for protected resources provided by the Resource Server.  In
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Authorization
      Server in trust domain B, and trusts cross-domain authorization
      grants Section 3 from the IdP Authorization Server.

   Resource Server (RS)  Hosts protected resources and validates access
      tokens issued by the Resource Authorization Server.  In
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Protected Resource
      in trust domain B.  The Resource Server has no direct trust
      relationship with the IdP Authorization Server.  Instead, it
      validates access tokens issued by its trusted Resource
      Authorization Server to determine who should have access to
      resources.

3.  Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant

   The Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant (ID-JAG) is a profile
   of the JWT Authorization Grant [RFC7523] that grants a client
   delegated access to a resource in another trust domain on behalf of a
   user without a direct user-approval step at the authorization server.

   An ID-JAG is issued and signed by an IdP Authorization Server similar
   to an ID Token [OpenID.Core], and contains claims about an End-User.
   Instead of being issued for a client (Relying Party in [OpenID.Core])
   as the intended audience for the assertion, it is instead issued with
   an audience of an Authorization Server in another trust domain
   (Resource Authorization Server).  It replaces the need for the client
   to obtain an authorization code from the Resource Authorization
   Server to delegate access to the client, and instead uses the IdP
   Authorization Server which is trusted by the Resource Authorization
   Server to delegate access to the client.

   As described in [OpenID.Core], ID Tokens are only intended to be
   processed by the Relying Party (indicated by the ID Token audience)
   or the Issuer (e.g. for revocation), and not by other actors in a
   different trust domain such as an Authorization Server.

   The following claims are used within the Identity Assertion JWT
   Authorization Grant:

   iss:  REQUIRED - The issuer identifier of the IdP Authorization
      Server as defined in [RFC8414].

   sub:  REQUIRED - Subject Identifier.  An identifier within the IdP
      Authorization Server for the End-User, which is intended to be
      consumed by the Client as defined in [OpenID.Core].  The
      identifier MUST be the same as the subject identifier used in an
      Identity Assertion for the Resource Authorization Server as a
      Relying Party for SSO.  A public subject identifier MUST be unique
      when scoped with issuer (iss+sub) for a single-tenant issuer and
      MUST be unique when scoped with issuer and tenant (iss+tenant+sub)
      for multi-tenant issuer.  See Section 5 for additional
      considerations.

   aud:  REQUIRED - The issuer identifier of the Resource Authorization
      Server as defined in [RFC8414].

   client_id:  REQUIRED - The client identifier of the OAuth 2.0
      [RFC6749] client at the Resource Authorization Server that will
      act on behalf of the resource owner (sub).  This identifier MAY be
      different that client identifier of the OAuth 2.0 client
      requesting an ID-JAG from the IdP Section 4.3 of [RFC8693] as it
      represents and independent client relationship to another
      Authorization Server in a different trust domain.  See Section 5
      for additional considerations.

   jti:  REQUIRED - Unique ID of this JWT as defined in Section 4.1.7 of
      [RFC7519].

   exp:  REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519].

   iat:  REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.6 of [RFC7519].

   resource:  OPTIONAL - The Resource Identifier (Section 2 of
      [RFC8707]) of the Resource Server (either a single URI or an array
      of URIs).

   scope:  OPTIONAL - a JSON string containing a space-separated list of
      scopes associated with the token, in the format described in
      Section 3.3 of [RFC6749].

   tenant:  OPTIONAL - JSON string that represents the tenant identifier
      for a multi-tenant issuer as defined in [OpenID.Enterprise]

   auth_time:  OPTIONAL - Time when End-User authenticated as defined in
      [OpenID.Core].

   acr:  OPTIONAL - Authentication Context Class Reference that was
      satisfied when authenticating the End-User as defined in
      [OpenID.Core].

   amr:  OPTIONAL - Identifiers for authentication methods used when
      authenticating the End-User as defined in [OpenID.Core].

   aud_sub:  OPTIONAL - The Resource Authorization Server's identifier
      for the End-User as defined in [OpenID.Enterprise].

   email: :OPTIONAL - End-User's e-mail address as defined in
   Section 5.1 of [OpenID.Core].

   The typ of the JWT indicated in the JWT header MUST be oauth-id-
   jag+jwt.  Using typed JWTs is a recommendation of the JSON Web Token
   Best Current Practices (Section 3.11 of [RFC8725]).

   A non-normative example JWT with expanded header and payload claims
   is below:

   {
     "typ": "oauth-id-jag+jwt"
   }
   .
   {
     "jti": "9e43f81b64a33f20116179",
     "iss": "https://acme.idp.example",
     "sub": "U019488227",
     "aud": "https://acme.chat.example/",
     "client_id": "f53f191f9311af35",
     "exp": 1311281970,
     "iat": 1311280970,
     "resource": "https://acme.chat.example/api",
     "scope": "chat.read chat.history",
     "auth_time": 1311280970,
     "amr": [
       "mfa",
       "phrh",
       "hwk",
       "user"
     ]
   }
   .
   signature

   The ID-JAG may contain additional authentication, identity, or
   authorization claims that are valid for an ID Token [OpenID.Core] as
   the grant functions as both an Identity Assertion and authorization
   delegation for the Resource Authorization Server.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the ID-JAG contain an email [OpenID.Core] and/
   or aud_sub [OpenID.Enterprise] claim.  The Resource Authorization
   Server MAY use these claims for account resolution or just-in-time
   (JIT) account creation, for example when the user has not yet SSO'd
   into the Resource Authorization Server.  Additional Resource
   Authorization Server specific identity claims MAY be needed for
   account resolution or JIT account creation.

4.  Cross-Domain Access

4.1.  Overview

   The example flow is for an enterprise acme, which uses a multi-tenant
   wiki app and chat app from different vendors, both of which are
   integrated into the enterprise's multi-tenant Identity Provider using
   OpenID Connect.

   1.  User authenticates with the IdP Authorization Server, the Client
       obtains an Identity Assertion (e.g. OpenID Connect ID Token or
       SAML 2.0 Assertion) for the user and optionally a Refresh Token
       (when using OpenID Connect) and signs the user in

   2.  Client uses the Identity Assertion or a previously issued Refresh
       Token from the IdP to request an Identity Assertion JWT
       Authorization Grant for the Resource Authorization Server from
       the IdP Authorization Server

   3.  Client exchanges the Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
       for an Access Token at the Resource Authorization Server's token
       endpoint

   4.  Client makes an API request to the Resource Server with the
       Access Token

   This specification is constrained to deployments where a set of
   Resource Authorization Servers for applications used by an
   organization are trusting the same IdP Authorization Server for
   Single Sign-On (SSO).  The IdP Authorization Server provides a
   consistent trust boundary and user identity for the set of Resource
   Authorization Servers to honor the ID-JAG issued by the IdP.  The
   Resource Authorization Server not only delegates user authentication
   but also delegates user authorization authority to the IdP
   Authorization Server for the scopes and resource specified in the ID-
   JAG and does not need obtain user consent directly from the resource
   owner.

4.2.  User Authentication

   The Client initiates an authentication request with the IdP
   Authorization Server using OpenID Connect or SAML.

   The following is an example using OpenID Connect

302 Redirect
Location: https://acme.idp.example/authorize?response_type=code&scope=openid%20offline_access&client_id=...

   The user authenticates with the IdP, and is redirected back to the
   Client with an authorization code, which it can then exchange for an
   ID Token and optionally a Refresh Token when offline_access scope is
   requested per [OpenID.Core].

   Note: The IdP Authorization Server may enforce security controls such
   as multi-factor authentication before granting the user access to the
   Client.

   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: acme.idp.example
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=authorization_code
   &code=.....

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...",
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "access_token": "7SliwCQP1brGdjBtsaMnXo",
     "refresh_token": "tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA"
     "scope": "openid offline_access"
   }

4.3.  Token Exchange

   The Client makes a Token Exchange [RFC8693] request to the IdP
   Authorization Server's Token Endpoint with the following parameters:

   requested_token_type:  REQUIRED - The value
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag indicates that an Identity
      Assertion JWT Authorization Grant is being requested.

   audience:  REQUIRED - The issuer identifier of the Resource
      Authorization Server as defined in Section 2 of [RFC8414].

   resource:  OPTIONAL - The Resource Identifier of the Resource Server
      as defined in Section 2 of [RFC8707].

   scope:  OPTIONAL - The space-separated list of scopes at the Resource
      Server that is being requested.

   subject_token:  REQUIRED - Either the Identity Assertion (e.g. the
      OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML 2.0 Assertion) for the target
      resource owner, or a Refresh Token previously issued by the IdP
      Authorization Server for that resource owner.  Implementations of
      this specification MUST accept Identity Assertions.  They MAY
      additionally accept Refresh Tokens to allow the client to obtain a
      new ID-JAG without performing a new single sign-on round trip when
      the Identity Assertion has expired.

   subject_token_type:  REQUIRED - An identifier, as described in
      Section 3 of [RFC8693], that indicates the type of the security
      token in the subject_token parameter.  For an OpenID Connect ID
      Token: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token, for a SAML 2.0
      Assertion: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2, and for a
      Refresh Token (when supported): urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-
      type:refresh_token.

   When a Refresh Token is used as the subject token, the client still
   requests requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-
   jag; this allows the client to refresh an Identity Assertion JWT
   Authorization Grant without fetching a new Identity Assertion from
   the user-facing SSO flow.

   The additional parameters defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC8693]
   actor_token and actor_token_type are not used in this specification.

   Client authentication to the Resource Authorization Server is done
   using the standard mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0.  Section 2.3.1
   of [RFC6749] defines password-based authentication of the client
   (client_id and client_secret), however, client authentication is
   extensible and other mechanisms are possible.  For example, [RFC7523]
   defines client authentication using bearer JSON Web Tokens using
   client_assertion and client_assertion_type.

4.3.1.  Example: Token Exchange using ID Token

   This example uses an ID Token as the subject_token and a JWT Bearer
   Assertion [RFC7523] for client authentication (tokens truncated for
   brevity):

POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: acme.idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
&audience=https://acme.chat.example/
&resource=https://api.chat.example/
&scope=chat.read+chat.history
&subject_token=eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...
&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...

4.3.1.1.  Example: Token Exchange using Refresh Token

   This non-normative example shows using a Refresh Token as the
   subject_token (when supported by the IdP Authorization Server) to
   obtain an ID-JAG without acquiring a new Identity Assertion:

POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: acme.idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
&audience=https://acme.chat.example/
&resource=https://api.chat.example/
&scope=chat.read+chat.history
&subject_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token
&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...

4.3.2.  Processing Rules

   The IdP MUST validate the subject token:

   *  If the subject token is an Identity Assertion, the IdP MUST
      validate the assertion and MUST validate that the audience of the
      assertion (e.g. the aud claim of the ID Token or SAML Audience)
      matches the client_id of the client authentication of the request.

   *  If the subject token is a Refresh Token, the IdP MUST validate it
      the same way it would for a standard refresh_token grant at the
      token endpoint: the token is issued by the IdP, bound to the
      authenticated client, unexpired, not revoked, and the requested
      scopes and audience remain within the authorization context of the
      Refresh Token.

   *  If the subject token is a Refresh Token, the IdP Authorization
      Server SHOULD retrieve or assemble the subject's claims needed for
      the ID-JAG in the same way it would when issuing a new Identity
      Assertion during a token request, so that the resulting ID-JAG
      reflects current subject attributes and policy.

   The IdP evaluates administrator-defined policy for the token exchange
   request and determines if the client should be granted access to act
   on behalf of the subject for the target audience and scopes.

   The IdP may also introspect the authentication context described in
   the SSO assertion to determine if step-up authentication is required.

4.3.3.  Response

   If access is granted, the IdP creates a signed Identity Assertion JWT
   Authorization Grant (Section 3) and returns it in the token exchange
   response defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC8693]:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",
     "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...",
     "token_type": "N_A",
     "scope": "chat.read chat.history",
     "expires_in": 300
   }

   issued_token_type:  REQUIRED - urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-
      jag

   access_token:  REQUIRED - The Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
      Grant.  (Note: Token Exchange requires the access_token response
      parameter for historical reasons, even though this is not an OAuth
      access token.)

   token_type:  REQUIRED - N_A (because this is not an OAuth access
      token.)

   scope:  OPTIONAL if the scope of the issued token is identical to the
      scope requested by the client; otherwise, it is REQUIRED.  Various
      policies in the IdP may result in different scopes being issued
      from the scopes the application requested.

   expires_in:  RECOMMENDED - The lifetime in seconds of the
      authorization grant.

   refresh_token:  OPTIONAL according to Section 2.2 of [RFC8693].  In
      the context of this specification, this parameter SHOULD NOT be
      used.

4.3.3.1.  Issued Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant

   The following is a non-normative example of the issued token

   {
     "typ": "oauth-id-jag+jwt"
   }
   .
   {
     "jti": "9e43f81b64a33f20116179",
     "iss": "https://acme.idp.example/",

       "user"
     ]
   }
   .
   signature

4.3.3.2.  Error Response

   On an error condition, the IdP returns an OAuth 2.0 Token Error
   response as defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749], e.g:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error": "invalid_grant",
     "error_description": "Audience validation failed"
   }

4.4.  Access Token Request

   The Client makes an access token request to the Resource
   Authorization Server's token endpoint using the previously obtained
   Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant as a JWT Bearer Assertion
   as defined by [RFC7523].

   grant_type:  REQUIRED - The value of grant_type is
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer

   assertion:  REQUIRED - The Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
      obtained in the previous token exchange step

   The Client authenticates with its credentials as registered with the
   Resource Authorization Server.

   For example:

   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: acme.chat.example
   Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
   assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...

4.4.1.  Processing Rules

   All of Section 5.2 of [RFC7521] applies, in addition to the following
   processing rules:

   *  Validate the JWT typ is oauth-id-jag+jwt (per Section 3.11 of
      [RFC8725])

   *  The aud claim MUST identify the Issuer URL of the Resource
      Authorization Server as the intended audience of the JWT.

   *  The client_id claim MUST identify the same client as the client
      authentication in the request.

   *  The Resource Authorization Server MUST follow Section 3.3 of
      [RFC6749] when processing the scope claim.

4.4.2.  Response

   The Resource Authorization Server's token endpoint responds with an
   OAuth 2.0 Token Response, e.g.:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
     "expires_in": 86400,
     "scope": "chat.read chat.history"
   }

4.4.3.  Refresh Token

   The Resource Authorization Server SHOULD NOT return a Refresh Token
   when an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization is exchanged for an
   Access Token per Section 5.2 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining].

   When the access token has expired, clients SHOULD re-submit the
   original Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant to obtain a new
   Access Token.  The ID-JAG replaces the use Refresh Token for the
   Resource Authorization Server.

   If the ID-JAG has expired, the Client SHOULD request a new ID-JAG
   from the IdP Authorization Server before presenting it to the
   Resource Authorization Sever using the original Identity Assertion
   from the IdP (e.g ID Token)

   If the ID Token is expired, the Client MAY use the Refresh Token
   obtained from the IdP during SSO to obtain a new ID Token which it
   can exchange for a new ID-JAG.  If the Client is unable to obtain a
   new Identity Assertion with a Refresh Token then it SHOULD re-
   authenticate the user by redirecting to the IdP.

   If the IdP Authorization Server supports Refresh Tokens as a
   subject_token in Token Exchange, the client can skip renewing the
   Identity Assertion and directly request a new ID-JAG by presenting
   the Refresh Token (see Section 4.3.1.1).

4.5.  SAML 2.0 Identity Assertion Interopability

   Clients using SAML 2.0 for SSO with the IdP Authorization Server can
   obtain an ID-JAG without changing their SSO protocol to OpenID
   Connect by first exchanging the SAML 2.0 assertion for a Refresh
   Token using Token Exchange.  This enables protocol transition to
   OAuth and allows the client to later use the Refresh Token as a
   subject_token to obtain an ID-JAG without prompting the user for a
   new Identity Assertion.

   The OpenID Connect scopes openid offline_access SHOULD be requested
   (additional scopes are allowed) when requesting a Refresh Token from
   the IdP Authorization Server.

   The IdP Authorization Server MUST map the SAML Audience to a Client
   ID and ensure the client's authentication matches that mapping before
   issuing the Refresh Token.

   The following non-normative example shows a SAML 2.0 assertion where
   the Audience value (from AudienceRestriction) corresponds to the
   Service Provider Entity ID (SPAuthority / SPEntityID) and MUST be
   mapped to the OAuth Client ID that the IdP Authorization Server
   associates with that SAML SP registration.

<saml2:Assertion xmlns:saml2="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"
    ID="_123456789" IssueInstant="2025-03-01T12:34:56Z" Version="2.0">

      </saml2:AuthnContextClassRef>
    </saml2:AuthnContext>
  </saml2:AuthnStatement>
</saml2:Assertion>

   When this assertion is used as the subject_token in Token Exchange,
   the IdP Authorization Server MUST verify that the Audience /
   SPEntityID maps to the OAuth Client ID that is authenticated for the
   token request.  This prevents a client from presenting an assertion
   issued for a different SAML SP.

  "scope": "openid offline_access email",
  "expires_in": 1209600
}

5.  Cross-Domain Client ID Handling

   There are three separate OAuth/OpenID Connect/SAML relationships
   involved in this flow:

   *  Client to IdP Authorization Server (OpenID Connect or SAML)

   *  Client to Resource Authorization Server (OAuth)

   *  Resource Authorization Server to IdP Authorization Server (OpenID
      Connect or SAML)

   Each relationship is typically represented by independent client
   registrations between each party.  For example, the IdP Authorization
   Server typically issues a Client ID for both the Client and Resource
   Authorization Server to use for single sign-on with OpenID Connect as
   a Relying Party.  Similarly, the Resource Authorization Server
   typically issues a Client ID for the Client to use for API access to
   the Resource Server.  The Client may choose to use different client
   credentials with each registration.

   In this flow, the IdP Authorization Server accepts a Token Exchange
   request from the Client, and issues an ID-JAG that will be consumed
   by the Resource Authorization Server.  This means the IdP
   Authorization Server needs to know about the relationship between the
   Client and the Resource Authorization Server, in order to include a
   client_id claim in the ID-JAG that will be recognized by the Resource
   Authorization Server.

   This can be handled by the IdP Authorization Server maintaining a
   record of each client_id used between Clients and Resource
   Authorization Servers, which will need to be obtained by out-of-band
   mechanisms.  The Client still needs to authenticate using its
   registered credential with the Resource Authorization Server when
   presenting the ID-JAG for the mapped client_id.  Requiring a
   confidential client helps to prevent the IdP Authorization Server
   from delegating access to any of the valid clients for the Resource
   Authorization Server.

   Note: The IdP Authorization Server is also responsible for mapping
   subject identifiers across Clients and trust domains in the ID-JAG.
   The same user may have a pair-wise subject identifier issued in an ID
   Token for SSO to the Client and another with SSO to the Resource
   Authorization Server as a Relying Party.  The Resource Authorization
   Server needs consistent subject identifiers for account resolution
   for both SSO and API access.  The IdP Authorization Server needs to
   ensure that the subject identifier issued in the ID-JAG is the same
   identifier for the user that it would have included in an ID Token
   intended for the Resource Authorization Server.

   Alternatively, if clients use "Client ID Metadata Document"
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document] as their client
   identifiers, this acts as a shared global namespace of Client IDs and
   removes the need for the IdP Authorization Server to maintain a
   mapping of each client registration.

6.  Authorization Server (IdP) Metadata

   An IdP can advertise its support for this profile in its OAuth
   Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414].  Identity and Authorization
   Chaining Across Domains [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining] defines a
   new metadata property
   identity_chaining_requested_token_types_supported for this purpose.

   To advertise support for the Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
   Grant, the authorization server SHOULD include the following value in
   the identity_chaining_requested_token_types_supported property:

   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Client Authentication

   This specification SHOULD only be supported for confidential clients.
   Public clients SHOULD use the existing authorization code grant and
   redirect the user to the Resource Authorization Server with an OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Request where the user can interactively consent to
   the access delegation.

7.2.  Step-Up Authentication

   In the initial token exchange request, the IdP may require step-up
   authentication for the subject if the authentication context in the
   subject's assertion does not meet policy requirements.  An
   insufficient_user_authentication OAuth error response may be returned
   to convey the authentication requirements back to the client similar
   to OAuth 2.0 Step-up Authentication Challenge Protocol [RFC9470].

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "error": "insufficient_user_authentication",
  "error_description": "Subject doesn't meet authentication requirements",
  "max_age": 5
}

   The Client would need to redirect the user back to the IdP to obtain
   a new assertion that meets the requirements and retry the token
   exchange.

   TBD: It may make more sense to request the Identity Assertion JWT
   Authorization Grant in the authorization request if using OpenID
   Connect for SSO when performing a step-up to skip the need for
   additional token exchange round-trip.

7.3.  Cross-Domain Use

   This specification is intended for cross-domain uses where the
   Client, Resource App, and Identity Provider are all in different
   trust domains.  In particular, the Identity Provider MUST NOT issue
   access tokens in response to an ID-JAG it issued itself.  Doing so
   could lead to unintentional broadening of the scope of authorization.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Media Types

   This section registers oauth-id-jag+jwt, a new media type [RFC2046]
   in the "Media Types" registry [IANA.media-types] in the manner
   described in [RFC6838].  It can be used to indicate that the content
   is an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant.

8.2.  OAuth URI Registration

   This section registers urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag in the
   "OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters" registry
   [IANA.oauth-parameters].

   *  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag

   *  Common Name: Token type URI for an Identity Assertion JWT
      Authorization Grant

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document: This document

8.3.  JSON Web Token Claims Registration

   This section registers resource in the "JSON Web Token Claims"
   subregistry of the "JSON Web Token (JWT)" registry [IANA.jwt].  The
   "JSON Web Token Claims" subregistry was established by [RFC7519].

   *  Claim Name: resource

   *  Claim Description: Resource

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): Section 3

Appendix A.  Use Cases

A.1.  Enterprise Deployment

   Enterprises often have hundreds of SaaS applications.  SaaS
   applications often have integrations to other SaaS applications that
   are critical to the application experience and jobs to be done.  When
   a SaaS app needs to request an access token on behalf of a user to a
   3rd party SaaS integration's API, the end-user typically needs to
   complete an interactive delegated OAuth 2.0 flow, as the SaaS
   application is not in the same security or policy domain as the 3rd
   party SaaS integration.

   It is industry best practice for an enterprise to connect their
   ecosystem of SaaS applications to their Identity Provider (IdP) to
   centralize identity and access management capabilities for the
   organization.  End-users get a better experience (SSO) and
   administrators get better security outcomes such multi-factor
   authentication and zero-trust.  SaaS applications today enable the
   administrator to establish trust with an IdP for user authentication.

   This specification can be used to extend the SSO relationship of
   multiple SaaS applications to include API access between these
   applications as well.  This specification enables federation for
   Authorization Servers across policy or administrative boundaries.
   The same enterprise IdP that is trusted by applications for SSO can
   be extended to broker access to APIs.  This enables the enterprise to
   centralize more access decisions across their SaaS ecosystem and
   provides better end-user experience for users that need to connect
   multiple applications via OAuth 2.0.

A.1.1.  Preconditions

   *  The Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the IdP
      Authorization Server

   *  The Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the Resource
      Authorization Server

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the Client for SSO and Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
      Grant

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the Resource Authorization Server for SSO and Identity
      Assertion JWT Authorization Grant

   *  Enterprise has granted the Client permission to act on behalf of
      users for the Resource Authorization Server with a set of scopes

A.2.  Email and Calendaring Applications

   Email clients can be used with arbitrary email servers, and cannot
   require pre-established relationships between each email client and
   each email server.  When an email client uses OAuth to obtain an
   access token to an email server, this provides the security benefit
   of being able to use strong multi-factor authentication methods
   provided by the email server's authorization server, but does require
   that the user go through a web-based flow to log in to the email
   client.  However, this web-based flow is often seen as disruptive to
   the user experience when initiated from a desktop or mobile native
   application, and so is often attempted to be minimized as much as
   possible.

   When the email client needs access to a separate API, such as a
   third-party calendaring application, traditionally this would require
   that the email client go through another web-based OAuth redirect
   flow to obtain authorization and ultimately an access token.

   To streamline the user experience, this specification can be used to
   enable the email client to use the Identity Assertion to obtain an
   access token for the third-party calendaring application without any
   user interaction.

A.2.1.  Preconditions

   *  The Client does not have a pre-registered OAuth 2.0 client at the
      IdP Authorization Server or the Resource Authorization Server

   *  The Client has obtained an Identity Assertion (e.g. ID Token) from
      the IdP Authorization Server

   *  The Resource Authorization Server is configured to allow the
      Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant from unregistered
      clients

A.3.  LLM Agent using Enterprise Tools

   AI agents, including those based on large language models (LLMs), are
   designed to manage user context, memory, and interaction state across
   multi-turn conversations.  To perform complex tasks, these agents
   often integrate with external systems such as SaaS applications,
   internal services, or enterprise data sources.  When accessing these
   systems, the agent operates on behalf of the end user, and its
   actions are constrained by the user’s identity, role, and permissions
   as defined by the enterprise.  This ensures that all data access and
   operations are properly scoped and compliant with organizational
   access controls.

A.3.1.  Preconditions

   *  The LLM Agent has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client (com.example.ai-
      agent) with the Enterprise IdP (cyberdyne.idp.example)

   *  The LLM Agent has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client (4960880b83dc9)
      with the External Tool Application (saas.example.net)

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the LLM Agent for SSO

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the External Tool Application for SSO and Identity Assertion
      JWT Authorization Grant

   *  Enterprise has granted the LLM Agent permission to act on behalf
      of users for the External Tool Application with a specific set of
      scopes

A.3.2.  Example Sequence

   The steps below describe the sequence of the LLM agent obtaining an
   access token using an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant
   (Section 3).

A.3.2.1.  LLM Agent establishes a User Identity with Enterprise IdP

   LLM Agent discovers the Enterprise IdP's OpenID Connect Provider
   configuration based on a configured issuer that was previously
   established.

      Note: IdP discovery where an agent discovers which IdP the agent
      should use to authenticate a given user is out of scope of this
      specification.

GET /.well-known/openid-configuration
Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
Accept: application/json

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/token",
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/keys",
  "registration_endpoint": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/oauth2/register",
  "scopes_supported": [
    "openid", "email", "profile"
  ],
  "response_types_supported": [
    "code"
  ],
  "grant_types_supported": [
    "authorization_code", "refresh_token", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange"
  ],
  "identity_chaining_requested_token_types_supported": ["urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag"],
  ...
}

   LLM Agent discovers all necessary endpoints for authentication as
   well as support for the Identity Chaining requested token type
   urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag

A.3.2.2.  IdP Authorization Request (with PKCE)

   LLM Agent generates a PKCE code_verifier and a code_challenge
   (usually a SHA256 hash of the verifier, base64url-encoded) and
   redirects the end-user to the Enterprise IdP with an authorization
   request

   GET /authorize?
     response_type=code
     &client_id=com.example.ai-agent
     &redirect_uri=https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback
     &scope=openid+profile+email
     &state=xyzABC123
     &code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM
     &code_challenge_method=S256
   Host: cyberdyne.idp.example

A.3.2.3.  User authenticates and authorizes LLM Agent

   Enterprise IdP authenticates the end-user and redirects back to the
   LLM Agent's registered client redirect URI with an authorization
   code:

https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=xyzABC123

   LLM Agent exchanges the code and PKCE code_verifier to obtain an ID
   Token and Access Token for the IdP's UserInfo endpoint

   POST /oauth2/token
   Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=authorization_code
   &code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
   &redirect_uri=https://ai-agent.example.com/oauth2/callback
   &client_id=com.example.ai-agent
   &code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...",
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "access_token": "7SliwCQP1brGdjBtsaMnXo",
     "scope": "openid profile email"
   }

   LLM Agent validates the ID Token using the published JWKS for the IdP

   {
     "iss": "https://cyberdyne.idp.example/",
     "sub": "1997e829-2029-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     "aud": "com.example.ai-agent",
     "exp": 1984444800,
     "iat": 1684441200,
     "auth_time": 1684440000,
     "name": "John Connor",
     "email": "john.connor@cyberdyne.example",
     "email_verified": true
   }

   LLM Agent now has an identity binding for context

A.3.2.4.  LLM Agent calls Enterprise External Tool

   LLM Agent tool calls an external tool provided by an Enterprise SaaS
   Application (Resource Server) without a valid access token and is
   issued an authentication challenge per Protected Resource Metadata
   [RFC9728].

      Note: How agents discover available tools is out of scope of this
      specification

   GET /tools
   Host: saas.example.net
   Accept: application/json

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
     "https://saas.example.net/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   LLM Agent fetches the external tool resource's OAuth 2.0 Protected
   Resource Metadata per [RFC9728] to dynamically discover an
   authorization server that can issue an access token for the resource.

   GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
   Host: saas.example.net
   Accept: application/json

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
      "resource":
        "https://saas.example.net/",
      "authorization_servers":
        [ "https://authorization-server.saas.com/" ],
      "bearer_methods_supported":
        ["header", "body"],
      "scopes_supported":
        ["agent.tools.read", "agent.tools.write"],
      "resource_documentation":
        "https://saas.example.net/tools/resource_documentation.html"
    }

   LLM Agent discovers the Authorization Server configuration per
   [RFC8414]

GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
Host: authorization-server.saas.com
Accept: application/json

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/token",
  "jwks_uri": "https://authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/keys",
  "registration_endpoint": "authorization-server.saas.com/oauth2/register",
  "scopes_supported": [
    "agent.read", "agent.write"
  ],
  "response_types_supported": [
    "code"
  ],
  "grant_types_supported": [
    "authorization_code", "refresh_token", "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer"
  ],
  ...
}

   LLM Agent has learned all necessary endpoints and supported
   capabilities to obtain an access token for the external tool.

   If the urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer grant type is
   supported the LLM can first attempt to silently obtain an access
   token using an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant from the
   Enterprise's IdP otherwise it can fallback to interactively obtaining
   a standard authorization_code from the SaaS Application's
   Authorization Server

      Note: This would benefit from an Authorization Server Metadata
      [RFC8414] property to indicate whether the Identity Assertion JWT
      Authorization Grant form of jwt-bearer would be accepted by this
      authorization server.  There are other uses of jwt-bearer that may
      be supported by the authorization server as well, and is not
      necessarily a reliable indication that the Identity Assertion JWT
      Authorization Grant would be supported.  See issue #16
      (https://github.com/aaronpk/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-
      assertion-authz-grant/issues/16).

A.3.2.5.  LLM Agent obtains an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization
          Grant for Enterprise External Tool from the Enterprise IdP

   LLM Agent makes an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant Token
   Exchange [RFC8693] request for the external tool's resource from the
   user's Enterprise IdP using the ID Token the LLM Agent obtained when
   establishing an identity binding context along with scopes and the
   resource identifier for the external tool that was returned in the
   tool's OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata

POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: cyberdyne.idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
&audience=https://authorization-server.saas.com/
&resource=https://saas.example.net/
&scope=agent.read+agent.write

&client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...

   If access is granted, the Enterprise IdP creates a signed Identity
   Assertion JWT Authorization Grant and returns it in the token
   exchange response defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC8693]:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",

   signature

A.3.2.6.  LLM Agent obtains an Access Token for Enterprise External Tool

   LLM Agent makes a token request to the previously discovered external
   tool's Authorization Server token endpoint using the Identity
   Assertion JWT Authorization Grant obtained from the Enterprise IdP as
   a JWT Assertion as defined by [RFC7523].

   The LLM Agent authenticates with its client credentials that were
   registered with the SaaS Authorization Server

      Note: How the LLM Agent registers with the Authorization Server
      (e.g static or dynamic client registration), and whether or not it
      has credentials, is out-of-scope of this specification

   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: authorization-server.saas.com
   Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
