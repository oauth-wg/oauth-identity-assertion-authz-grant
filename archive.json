The profile describes how an ID Token is used to get a JWT Authorization Grant and then to get an Access Token for that JWT Authorization Grant. The scope can be defined by the client when requesting the access token.\r\n\r\nAs the JWT Authorization Grant profile is designed to allow interop across several domains, each AS in the participating domain will support creating authorization grant JWTs as well as accepting authorization grant JWTs to issue access tokens.\r\n\r\nUsually a client receives an access token alongside the ID Token and the client can use Token Exchange to get additional access tokens with equal or narrowed down scope.\r\n\r\nThe ID Token does not contain any scope. So even if a client only received an Access Token with a specific narrow scope, the client could abuse this grant by asking AS of domain A for an authorization grant JWT based on the Id Token and then use this authz grant JWT at the AS of domain A again to obtain a new access token with arbitrary scope (up to what is allowed for the client as per policy).\r\n\r\nAlthough this could be prohibited by the AS not accepting authorization grant JWTs it issued itself, the client could request the authorization grant JWT from the AS of domain B with just a couple more steps.\r\n\r\nGranted, this may not be relevant for the enterprise environment the JWT authorization grant profile is meant for as the End-User is usually not asked for giving consent to the scope requested by clients and instead the allowed scope in defined by policies within the AS configs. However, I'd like to ask if this is something worth to consider.",

In doing that,  step 3 is fine because right now clients already are registered with the RS AS to request tokens directly and facilitate SSO flows. We wanted to lean into that by shifting as much of the burden to the identity provider, especially since the identity provider has all of the information about the user/organization and their relationships.\r\n\r\nI do like the simplicity of the proposed modified scenario and I think we should continue hammering out details to see if this kind of approach could work.\r\n\r\nI think we also agree that front loading the `client_id` and `resource` identifiers for mapping on the identity provider is not ideal. Unfortunately, I also believe requiring the IdP to register a client on every RS AS to do a new on-behalf exchange is not ideal either, especially since that is technically 3rd party to the existing client and AS oAuth registration/trust relationship.",

The main feedback we've heard from implementers is they want to know whether an access token request will work with this flow for a given user. That is more than just whether the grant type is supported at the AS, because it also depends on the policies configured at the IdP. So what's actually needed is more of a \"list the applications I'll be able to get an access token using an ID-JAG from given the user and application context\", which looks more like a service call and less like a static discovery document.",

For SSO this is solved with IdP discovery (e.g identifier first) or some apps may have a dedicated tenant URL for just SSO but share a common namespace for API Access. \n- Just like IdP discovery this could be considered information disclosure and enables an attacker to learn what issuers to attack next\n\nUnclear is requiring client authentication to discover trusted issuers would address any concerns as clients could also be multi-tenant but may be useful in helping with abuse",

This could allow the IDP to return new ID-JAGs without a new ID token having been requested.\n\n## Resource App refresh tokens\n\nThe resource app could return a refresh token along with the access token.

          "body": "I've had some time to think about this and just wanted to add a few comments and thoughts on this. \n\nFor the first option, **IDP refresh tokens**, there could be a refresh token returned with the initial ID token (green text appended to the diagram on the MCP PR):\n\n<img width=\"927\" height=\"409\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f14802c0-b57a-48e8-bfd8-1f4fd5a926fd\" />\n\nTo refresh the service's access token, the MCP Client (\"Client\" going forward) would:\n\n1. Use the refresh token with the IDP to get a new ID token\n2. Use that ID token with the IDP to get a new ID JAG\n3. ... continues as previously described\n\nThat would allow the IDP to stay in the loop and invalidate the refresh process as needed (admin action, automated protection, etc). That would end up being 3 HTTP requests for a single refresh, though, which is a lot in the case of access tokens with a short life. \n\nFor the second, **Resource App refresh tokens**, you said that the Client could request access tokens that the IDP wouldn't know about but the IDP would know that refresh tokens were allowed. Section 5 (page 8) of the \"Identity Assertion Authorization Grant\" document talks about the token exchange request and includes API scopes as a part of that request.\n\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/\n\nThe `offline_access` scope could be requested there and then the IDP would know that refresh tokens are being requested. It could not control the refresh process, of course, so it makes sense to caution about that approach.\n\nThat leads me to a question here in the context of this being applied to 3rd party APIs: how can the IDP be aware of the scopes being requested, `offline_access` or otherwise? I don't see that property mentioned in [your blog post](https://aaronparecki.com/2025/05/12/27/enterprise-ready-mcp) and can't really think of a great way for the IDP to get that knowledge and keep it up to date.\n\nOne thing that came to mind is maybe the 3rd party URL could present a consent screen with all allowed scopes as selectable. Claude can get a text response with an URL and present it to a user and this type of interaction looks like it will be more formalized in the spec going forward (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/887).\n\nThanks again for your work in this space!",

      "body": "**Summary**\nThis proposal considers a protocol-level solution for scenarios where a user needs to connect to a specific instance (e.g., tenant, organziation, workspace) of a Resource App, particularly when these multiple instances share a common issuer URL. The goal is to create a mechanism that allows a Requesting App to specify the target instance and ensures this choice is communicated end-to-end, so it can be correctly interpreted by both the IdP and the Resource App's authorization server.\n\n**Problem**\nIn many enterprise environments, a single application may offer multiple distinct instances. For example, consider an observability platform with separate instances for `development` and `production` logs. Often, these instances share a single `audience` (i.e., issuer URL) and `resource` identifier for their APIs. In these cases, access to the Resource App's API is managed by a custom claim injected into the `access_token` after the user authenticates with a specific instance.\n\nThe current Identity Assertion Authorization Grant does not define a standard way for a Requesting App to specify a target instance under these conditions. This ambiguity prevents a seamless user experience, which should ideally mirror selecting an application from an SSO dashboard and being directed to the correct instance.\n\nThis overall challenge can be broken down into two parts:\n\n**1. The Discovery Problem** \nBefore a user can make a choice, the Requesting App must first know what choices are available. How can the Requesting App learn which Resource Apps, and their specific instances, the logged-in user is permitted to connect to?\n\nWhile solving discovery is critical for the end-to-end experience, it is handled separately in issue https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/issues/52. For this issue, we will assume the Requesting App has a method to determine which instance the user wants to access.\n\n**2. The Request Problem** \nThis is the focus of the proposal. Once the user has selected an instance, how does the Requesting App communicate this choice to the IdP? The current protocol lacks a standard parameter to differentiate the target instance when it shares an `audience`/issuer URL with others.\n\n**Proposal**\n**We propose using the `client_id` of the target Resource App instance within the IdP** as the unique identifier. This `client_id` would be included in the initial Token Exchange request and the resulting Identity Assertion (ID-JAG).\n\nRationale:\n- Uniqueness & Existing Trust: Each Resource App instance registered with the IdP for SSO already has a unique `client_id`. This identifier is known and trusted by both the IdP and the Resource App.\n- IdP Policy Enforcement: The IdP can use the provided `client_id` to locate and apply the specific authorization policies associated with that instance.\n- Resource App Tenant Mapping: The Resource App's Authorization Server already relies on this `client_id` for its OIDC federation with the IdP. It can therefore use the `client_id` from the assertion to unambiguously map the request to the correct internal tenant, organization, or workspace.\n",

The ID-JAG acts as a cross-domain Identity Assertion so it should assert an identity similar to an id token issued by the IdP for the resource app\n\n[Resource, Audience, and Scope](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693#name-relationship-between-resour) are linked as you need all 3 to uniquely identify an authorization delegation for an AS and ensure there isn't a mix-up attack with an ambiguous scope name for example.  These have existing foundation in the security properties of the token request and I don't think we should be trying to overload.  These values should be consistent across OAuth specs and may be discovered with Protected Resource Metadata or Authorization Server metadata for example.\n\nThe ID-JAG audience (the one processing the ID-JAG) is the [Resource App's Authorization Server identifier ](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rfc7523bis-03#name-updates-to-rfc-7523) and must be unique within the IdP tenant as it functions as the cross-domain identifier to give the IdP context of the cross-domain request while resource+scope is relative to the Resource App's Authorization Server and may not be unique within the IdP tenant.  I think you may be identifying a gap here as that AS may be multi-tenant but the identifier isn't and when used a key there isn't a way to have multiple instances for different tenants.  This would be something like `aud_tenant` similar to `aud_sub` in https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-enterprise-extensions-1_0.html#name-aud_sub.  Its not clear how the IdP obtains this value and how its bound.\n\nThe ID-JAG presenter is a client that is registered in the Resource App's Authorization Server.  There is currently undefined behavior on how the IdP selects what client in the Resource App Authorization Server the ID-JAG should be used by and can act as the user.  This IdP can assert any client it wants and the Resource App Authorization Server needs to determine what it trusts.  We currently don't require client authentication is required for the ID-JAG token request to the Resource App Authorization Server (its vague).  Providing some security considerations and optionally some processing instructions was the goal of #45.   There is also an open issue to define how to bind the ID-JAG to a key so that the presenter must demonstrate proof of possession #28 .  If we require client authentication or DPOP for the ID-JAG than only a client that knows the secret/key/etc can use the the ID-JAG.  This should help with mix-up attacks/etc.\n\nMy reading of this issue is the following\n\n- The Resource App Authorization Server identifier is multi-tenant (e.g doesn't have tenant in the identifier such `http://as.example.com`)\n- The Resource App Authorization Server has a per-tenant client registration and the client identifier is unique across tenants\n- The protected resource that the client wants to obtain cross-domain access to isn't tenant specific (e.g `https://rs.example.com`)\n\nNot sure if the subject that the ID-JAG asserts resolves to an account in a specific Resource App tenant or not.  Would each environment (e.g development vs production) have a different subject identifier for the user?  What does the IdP put into an ID Token for SSO to these instances?\n\nI think the issue of selecting the client for the ID-JAG might be similar to user as well if there is one to many relationship between the IdP the Resource App tenants and accounts.  An ID-JAG currently doesn't identify a Resource App tenant but rather this handled by processing the Resource App processing the `iss`, `sub`, `tenant` of the identity assertion and the `client_id`.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Resource App AS is multi-tenant while the `audience`, `resource` and `client_id` - used by the Requesting App - are unique across tenants. To make things a bit more complex, the same IdP user `sub` can map to multiple of these tenants, but I think you\u2019re spot on in saying that determining the tenant may follow the same procedures that are used to do the same for SSO flows. In those cases, we either:\n\n1.  ask the end user <- this is not an option in this case\n2. receive the id of the tenant in the login request, or \n3. infer it from sort of the \u201caccount\u201d being used on the Resource App AS - we really call them connections and they represent a specific integration with a federated upstream IdP. Several of these accounts may map to the same IdP user but they define a local difference, let\u2019s say a different local user, we can work with.\n\nFocussing on option 3: for normal SSO, each of these \u201caccounts\u201d/connections map to a specific `client_id` on the IdP, that is used to start the login flow from the Resource App AS tenant. It is the `client_id` that would be used to sign in if the user clicks on that specific \u201cResource App instance\u201d (e.g the datadog-dev app instance in our example) on the IdP SSO dashboard. This is precisely the piece of information I think we\u2019re missing and we need to receive in the ID-JAG. It is actually better than configuring the `tenant_id` along with the Resource App instance -that would be equivalent to option 2 - as the IdP naturally knows its own client_ids, so we avoid having to configure any additional attribute on the IdP and instead we encapsulate the logic to determine the tenant within the Resource App AS itself. In summary,  the idea would be to determine the Resource App tenant from the audience + resource-app-instance-client-id@IdP coming in the ID-JAG. If this makes sense, we \u201cjust\u201d have to find the proper element for this client_id to travel within the assertion.\n",

We are considering revising the document to remove this term as it doesn't appear in any other OIDC or OAuth specs and is a new concept that introduces cognitive complexity to the reader who is coming from either OIDC or OAuth.  Resource app is just a relying party that has an OAuth Client for SSO with an OpenID Provider and also provides an Authorization Server for its protected resources and is in a different trust domain than the client. \n\nWe are basically trying to find a workaround for a tenant identifier for the audience (`aud_tenant`) of the ID-JAG.  Using the client identifier for the RP that was used to account link the subject in the ID Token is a proxy for the `aud_tenant` to enable account resolution.  Since its a proxy, its not perfect for all deployments.  Since the OP doesn't known this value it would require additional administrative configuration and also introduces new security complexity to account linking/resolution when its admin-defined.  Note, this would only be for RPs where the OP doesn't have a connection with SCIM or OP Commands that could obtain an RP specific identifier for the account or tenant.\n\nLooking over to our friend SAML, they did define the concept of `SPNameQualifier` which help scopes the Subject `NameID` \n\n```\nSPNameQualifier [Optional]\nFurther qualifies a name with the name of a service provider or affiliation of providers. This\nattribute provides an additional means to federate names on the basis of the relying party or\nparties.\n```\n\nThis effectively enables \"tenant\" like scenarios in SAML subjects.  This is what I was after with `sub_client_id` as way to qualify the subject identifier.  If `tenant` is too strong a term and we want a more generic concept then we could take inspiration from SAML and have `aud_sub_qualifier` or something (note: `aud_sub` is a claim in [OIDC Enterprise Extensions](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-enterprise-extensions-1_0.html#name-aud_sub)).

See https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant-01.html#name-refresh-token\n\nAdding support for `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token` as the `subject_token` in the ID-JAG Token Exchange request would eliminate the round-trip needed to obtain the ID Token first as the IdP Authorization Server can dereference the refresh token to obtain the same claims that would be present in the ID Token.\n\nWe should also consider recommending that the IdP Authorization Server MAY return a `refresh_token` when exchanging a `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2` token as the `subject_token` for an ID-JAG.  This would enable a Client that uses SAML for SSO to obtain a refresh token that they can use to renew ID-JAGs without having to switch to OIDC or redirect the user over the front channel. ",

Since the goal is the ID-JAG and not the ID Token and there needs to be a way to obtain new ID-JAGs from the IdP, the optimized flow was to just add support for Refresh Token as the input vs RT->ID Token, ID-Token->ID-JAG, ID-JAG->Access Token.

It keeps the protocol simple with min surface area.  \n\n```\ngrant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange\nsubject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2\n&subject_token=PHNhbWxwOl...[base64url-encoded SAML2 Assertion]...\n&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token\n&scope=openid%20offline_access\n```\n\n```\n {\n  \"access_token\":\"eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjllciJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJo\n    dHRwczovL2JhY2tlbmQuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FzLmV\n    4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNDQxOTE3NTkzLCJpYXQiOjE0NDE5MTc1MzMsIn\n    N1YiI6ImJkY0BleGFtcGxlLmNvbSIsInNjb3BlIjoiYXBpIn0.40y3ZgQedw6rx\n    f59WlwHDD9jryFOr0_Wh3CGozQBihNBhnXEQgU85AI9x3KmsPottVMLPIWvmDCM\n    y5-kdXjwhw\",\n  \"issued_token_type\":\n      \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token\",\n  \"token_type\":\"N/A\",\n  \"expires_in\":60,\n  \"refresh_token\": \"xOTE3NTkzLCJpYXQiOjE0N...\"  // This is only for SAML and up to \n }\n```\n\n3) IdP MAY support exchanging a Refresh Token for an ID-JAG\n\n```\ngrant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange\n&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token\n&subject_token=xOTE3NTkzLCJpYXQiOjE0N...\n&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag\n```\n\nThis would enable an optimized refresh for when ID-JAG + ID Assertion expire as well as allow a SAML RP to convert to OAuth/OIDC so it can support refreshes.

Curious on other's thoughts there.\r\n\r\n",

Access Token lifetimes are managing performance/scale/security tradeoffs and specific to the Resource AS-RS implementation.  ID-JAG can be sender-constrained and also have client authentication.  It don't think it needs to have single use processing semantics.  The ID-JAG lifetime should serialize an access delegation that meets the attenuation requirements of the IDP policy that could have shared signals/etc with the Resource AS.   I don't see an issue with an ID-JAG with a lifetime in hours not minutes for example.  I wouldn't expect days.  Its not a refresh token.\r\n",

I think that data can be propagated to other places, or in case the directory source is elsewhere, the same can be used in the Enterprise Authorization Server, so I feel having the ID-JAG issuer as being decoupled from the IdP is a valid use case. The authorization data (i.e. what resources the user is permitted to access and with what scopes) is an authorization concern, which could be decoupled from the IdP, although I agree that today it is common for that information to also be with the IdP.",

Here are some I can think of\r\n\r\nPro\r\n- IdP doesn't have to natively support ID-JAG enabling adoption  of ID-JAG outside of IdP as the Resource AS can trust different issuers\r\n- Another enterprise system can provide an authorization capability enabling best of breed for enterprise\r\n- Resource AS could trust multiple ID-JAG issuers for the Enterprise without complicating or changing IdP configuration for SSO\r\n\r\nCon\r\n- Introduces need to explain and manage/control how both issuers are part of the same trust domain and this doesn't introduce a 3rd trust domain for identity chaining.  The EAS can effectively perform an on-behalf-of for an IdP identity for a downstream resource without the IdP knowing what resource (no constrained delegation).\r\n- More complicated discovery for Client to know how to get an ID-JAG\r\n- Resource AS may need to support more complex claims mapping that could add more security surface area to attack.  It can't assume its the IdP and keep same account resolution logic used for SSO (e.g different issuers for example).\r\n- More ambiguity on how this is different than Vanilla JWT Authorization Grant\r\n- Exchanging an Access Token for an ID-JAG that looks like an Access Token just with different type for yet another Access Token adds cognitive overhead and will create confusion on why not just use the original Access Token as grant and bypass all the additional layers of abstraction.  The audience of an access token for a resource indicator request could be the EAS or the Resource AS for example.\r\n- Introduces need to profile the Access Token for Token Exchange interoperability with Enterprise AS\r\n- Access Token for Token Exchange may not contain necessary authentication context to make an authorization decision (e.g zero-trust) that was previously in IdP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

SSO to the Resource AS  as a RP has account resolution mechanism already that needs to be modified to support split roles for ID-JAG processing.   Previously it could ensure that the `iss` + `sub` of ID-JAG ==`iss` + `sub` of ID Token.  They both has the same identifier scope.  This is no longer the case.  EAS may not be authoritative for every `sub` of the IdP.  It can't just replace the ID Token `iss` with EAS `iss` when identifying the resource owner (assuming EAS has a mechanism to obtain the IdPs' `sub`).   This is the cross-domain account resolution vulnerabilities this change introduces that I prefer we have don't leave to deployment.   For example if `aud_sub` was required to identify the resource owner then  ther is no ambiguity for account resolution as the scope of the identifier is always local to the Resource AS.   I don't think its practical to require `aud_sub`, just illustrating the point.  ",

Client begins with knowing they want to access the RS, and needs to discover where to get the access token for it. It goes to the RAS (possibly through OPRM), and then the RAS has the same problem, where does it send the user to get an ID-JAG.

This doesn't address the problem in 2  as it just says you have access to the EAS not what trusted RAS resources. \r\n2) Discovery of what Resource Authorization Servers are trusted by an IdP is tracked in https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/issues/52.  Discovery of whether a RAS accepts an ID-JAG was covered by https://github.com/oauth-wg/oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/issues/34.  The Client knew a user's IdP so could discover connected resources from the IdP just like SSO.  I think the delta here was the assumption that resource owner for the RAS only belonged to as single IdP (e.g. `iss`+`sub`) so if the RAS supported ID-JAG via metadata and the IdP support ID-JAG via metadata then the Client could attempt to obtain an ID-JAG from the IDP.  They may not be authorized or the RAS not trusted which would be a runtime error hence need for a discovery call to enumerate whats allowed.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of what issuers a RAS trust would more than likely need to be an authenticated call (e.g. client assertion)",

However, the `iss+sub` is _different_ because the issuer is now different.  In order to safely map the user to the same account, domain B would have to have some out-of-band knowledge that the IDP and EAS represent the same domain, despite being separate issuers.",
